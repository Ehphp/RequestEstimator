# Project Summary
The project is a web application focused on managing estimated requirement lists for project management, emphasizing deterministic estimation techniques. It enhances user experience through features such as smart defaulting, metadata management, activity cataloging, automated calculations, and CSV export capabilities. The application leverages Shadcn-ui, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to deliver a modern, responsive interface that streamlines workflows and improves estimation accuracy.

# Project Module Description
The web app includes the following functional modules:
- **Requirement Management**: Manage requirement lists with associated metadata (owner, period, notes).
- **Deterministic Estimation**: Implement a system for deterministic estimation using drivers and multipliers.
- **Activity Catalog**: Provide a catalog of activities with helper descriptions.
- **Automated Calculations**: Automatically calculate subtotals, contingencies, and totals.
- **CSV Export**: Enable simple export of data in CSV format.
- **Smart Defaulting**: Introduce intelligent defaults for fields based on user input and presets.
- **User Interface**: Create an interface for managing requirements and estimates.
- **Requirement Information Section**: Display detailed information about requirements during the estimation process.
