# Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web application that facilitates the management of estimated requirement lists, leveraging core functionalities outlined in a specification document for a deterministic estimation system. This system will include features such as metadata management, deterministic estimation, activity cataloging, automated calculations, and simple export options. While the original document suggests using Power Platform technologies, the project will utilize Shadcn-ui, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to create a demo web app.

# Project Module Description
The web app will include the following functional modules:
- **Requirement Management**: Manage requirement lists with associated metadata (owner, period, notes).
- **Deterministic Estimation**: Implement a system for deterministic estimation using drivers and multipliers.
- **Activity Catalog**: Provide a catalog of activities with helper descriptions.
- **Automated Calculations**: Calculate subtotals, contingencies, and totals automatically.
- **CSV Export**: Enable simple export of data in CSV format.
- **User Interface**: Create an interface for managing requirements and estimates.
