# Project Summary
The project is a web application designed for managing estimated requirement lists in project management, utilizing deterministic estimation techniques. It enhances user experience through features like metadata management, automated calculations, and CSV export capabilities. By leveraging modern technologies such as Shadcn-ui, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, the application aims to improve workflow efficiency and estimation accuracy. Recent updates have integrated Supabase as the backend for data management, allowing for persistent data storage and improved collaboration across devices. The application now fully supports cloud data persistence and includes a comprehensive user interface for managing requirements.

# Project Module Description
The web app includes the following functional modules:
- **Requirement Management**: Manage requirement lists with associated metadata (owner, period, notes).
- **Deterministic Estimation**: Implement a system for deterministic estimation using drivers and multipliers.
- **Activity Catalog**: Provide a catalog of activities with helper descriptions.
- **Automated Calculations**: Automatically calculate subtotals, contingencies, and totals.
- **CSV Export**: Enable export of data in CSV format.
- **Smart Defaulting**: Introduce intelligent defaults for fields based on user input and presets.
- **User Interface**: Create an interface for managing requirements and estimates.
- **Risk & Contingency Management**: Incorporate risks into the estimation process, allowing users to see how selected risks affect contingency calculations.
- **Database Management**: Utilize Supabase for data storage, ensuring data persistence and security.
