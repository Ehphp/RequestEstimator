# Project Summary
The project is developing a web application for managing estimated requirement lists, focusing on deterministic estimation for project management. It aims to enhance user experience with features like smart defaulting, metadata management, activity cataloging, automated calculations, and CSV export capabilities. The application utilizes Shadcn-ui, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to create a modern and responsive interface.

# Project Module Description
The web app includes the following functional modules:
- **Requirement Management**: Manage requirement lists with associated metadata (owner, period, notes).
- **Deterministic Estimation**: Implement a system for deterministic estimation using drivers and multipliers.
- **Activity Catalog**: Provide a catalog of activities with helper descriptions.
- **Automated Calculations**: Automatically calculate subtotals, contingencies, and totals.
- **CSV Export**: Enable simple export of data in CSV format.
- **Smart Defaulting**: Introduce intelligent defaults for fields based on user input and presets.
- **User Interface**: Create an interface for managing requirements and estimates.
