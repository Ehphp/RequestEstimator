# Project Summary
The project is a web application designed for managing estimated requirement lists in project management, focusing on deterministic estimation techniques. It enhances user experience with features such as metadata management, automated calculations, and CSV export capabilities. The application utilizes modern technologies like Shadcn-ui, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to provide a responsive interface, thereby improving workflow efficiency and estimation accuracy.

# Project Module Description
The web app includes the following functional modules:
- **Requirement Management**: Manage requirement lists with associated metadata (owner, period, notes).
- **Deterministic Estimation**: Implement a system for deterministic estimation using drivers and multipliers.
- **Activity Catalog**: Provide a catalog of activities with helper descriptions.
- **Automated Calculations**: Automatically calculate subtotals, contingencies, and totals.
- **CSV Export**: Enable simple export of data in CSV format.
- **Smart Defaulting**: Introduce intelligent defaults for fields based on user input and presets.
- **User Interface**: Create an interface for managing requirements and estimates.
- **Requirement Information Section**: Display detailed information about requirements during the estimation process.
- **Risk & Contingency Management**: Incorporate risks into the estimation process, allowing users to see how selected risks affect contingency calculations.
